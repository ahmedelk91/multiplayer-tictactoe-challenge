# Networked multiplayer Tic Tac Toe challenge

In this challenge you will build a networked multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game.

This means two different users on two different clients should be able to navigate to the game and play Tic Tac Toe against each other in real-time.

Below is an example of the kind of multiplayer behavior we are looking for.

#### Game Initialization:
User 1 and User 2 navigate to game link and see an empty Tic Tac Toe board.

#### Move-1: 
User 1 clicks on a square and it fills with an O. User 2 sees this O appear in realtime.

User 1 client:

User 2 client:

#### Move-2: 
User 2 clicks on a square and it fills with an X. User 1 sees this X appear in realtime.
